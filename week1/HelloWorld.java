        PROBLEM 1

 * 
 * put the addition method (machine) in another class (tab)
 * 
 * 
 * -look at the most recent zoom lecture to see how it can be referenced in the main method
 *      -theres gonna be something about trying to reference them
 *      -and in the main method, that is where the inputs for the numbers (variables) is gonna be
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *      PROBLEM 2
 * 
 * 
 * do you think that there is a way to make have some thing that continues to add one more
 * character of whatever it is untill it prints it out to the desired amount of times.
 * -an idea ( [print]a = #, count = 0 (start print here), count <5 (prints untill the counter reaches under 5)))
 * 
 * 
 * or you could have a bunch of variables that are listed as different amounts of #'s
 * -like a = "#"
 *       b = "##"
 *       c = "###"
 *       d = "####"
 *         ...
 * 
 * and then reference them in the main method in the order that they are supposed to appear
 * 
 * 
 *
